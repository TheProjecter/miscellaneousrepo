Building
========
`scons bin/parser bin/assembler bin/translator' or `make'

Running
=======bin/parser <grammar_file> <file.jack|directory>

This will process the input grammar and based on the rules specified therein it will output parsed code from <file.jack> to <file.xml> in XML format.

--bin/assembler <file.asm>

This will convert assembler instructions to machine code for the Hack platform.

--bin/translator <file.vm|directory>

This will convert virtual machine code to assembler code.

--

Samples are in each of the programs' directories.

TODO
====
- make parser generator for LL(k) parsers based on input grammar instead of backtracking parser
- virtual machine to run .hack code on

Other
=====
The specifications of the Jack language and Hack platform are from "The Elements of Computing Systems" (2005) by Noam Nissan.
