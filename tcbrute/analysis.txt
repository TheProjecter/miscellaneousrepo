Comparison between 2x NVIDIA 280M GTX (SLI) with 128 cuda cores and Intel Q9000 @ 2GHz (quad core)
==================================================================================================


1) GPU
=======

with all modes of operation, but only AES as encryption algo, and only RIPEMD160 as prf:


read 32768 passwords
CUDA-capable device count: 2
Computing with 2 GPU's...
success, password = secret, ea = 1, mode = 1, prf = 1
  GPU Processing time: 144551.203125 (ms)


so ~226 passwords per second with 64 * 8 threads per GPU


read 32768 passwords
CUDA-capable device count: 2
Computing with 2 GPU's...
success, password = secret, ea = 1, mode = 1, prf = 1
  GPU Processing time: 106177.875000 (ms)


so ~308 passwords per second with 64 * 32 threads per GPU

read 32768 passwords
CUDA-capable device count: 2
Computing with 2 GPU's...
success, password = secret, ea = 1, mode = 1, prf = 1
  GPU Processing time: 106089.039062 (ms)

so with 128*32 threads per GPU about same result

keeping 128*32 threads for next tests

if uncomenting encryption algos (so that 8/13 are enabled, everything but twofish):
read 32768 passwords
CUDA-capable device count: 2
Computing with 2 GPU's...
success, password = secret, ea = 1, mode = 1, prf = 1
  GPU Processing time: 223662.859375 (ms)

so ~146 passwords per second


if uncommenting prfs (including the code for launching their derive calculations):
Main.cpp(81) : cutilCheckMsg() CUTIL CUDA error : reduceKernel_final() execution failed.
 : unspecified launch failure.

without whirlpool and sha1 (so just ripemd160 and sha512):
fails after 28 sec

without whirlpool and sha512 (ripemd160 and sha1):
read 32768 passwords
CUDA-capable device count: 2
Computing with 2 GPU's...
success, password = secret, ea = 1, mode = 1, prf = 1
  GPU Processing time: 146899.656250 (ms)


without sha512:
read 32768 passwords
CUDA-capable device count: 2
Computing with 2 GPU's...
Main.cpp(81) : cutilCheckMsg() CUTIL CUDA error : reduceKernel_final() execution failed.
 : unspecified launch failure.

2) CPU
======

CPU is 2 times slower with only ~151 passwords per second if only AES/RIPEMD160 are used.

With all EAs/PRFs enabled, CPU gets 1935.42s for 32k passwords, 9 times slower (~17 passwords per second)
that's consistent with the advertised speed of true.crypt brute
or 16 passwords in 0.894167, so no significant performance loss as input size increases
